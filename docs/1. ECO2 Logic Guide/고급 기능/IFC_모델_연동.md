```   
WHAT & WHEN:   
                1. Decision making (by April)   
                2. Major development completed (~70% by June-July)   
                3. Revisions and finalization (Second Half of the Year)   
```
```   
HOW & WHICH:            
                1. Based on the Original Contents, but:   
                   with necessary 1) Reorganization, 2) Improvements, 3) Inserting Images   
   
                2. Work smartly (Discuss thoroughly before execution so that rework is minimized)   
                   
                3. Keep frequent communication   
                    Between institutions, through coordinator   
                    Key communication channels are as follows:   
                        - 한희↔박정은   
                        - 한희↔장예은   
                        - 연구원들↔교수님   
                        - 박정은↔장예은   
                        - 이승연↔장예은   
                        - 장예은↔유기형   
   
                4. Technical approach   
                    Compatibility with both Mac and Windows platforms   
                    Required tools for development and documentation include:   
                        - Python (essential for MkDocs)   
                        - Git (version control for local tracking)   
                        - Visual Studio Code, VS Code (main editing environment)   
                        - MkDocs (Core documentation tool)   
                        - GitHub (to ensure a stable setup and smooth collaboration workflow)   
                    Once you, maybe 희, have completed the environment setup with   
                    Python, Git, VS Code, and MkDocs,   
                    you will primarily work with the following languages and file types:   
                        - Markdown (.md)   
                        - YAML (.yml)   
                        - HTML (.html)   
                        - CSS (.css)   
                        - JavaScript (.js)   
                        - Python (.py)   
                    For the ECO2 Logic Guide, both mathematical expressions and mindmaps are crucial;   
                        - Mermaid.js: for mindmap   
                        - MathJax (or KaTeX): for LaTeX, a grammar for mathematical expressions   
                    (updated on 2025/03/23)   
                    After setting all these above, the next step is to load VeryColdplay's 'eco2_guide_center' project on your computer.   
                    To do this, you should follow the following: 5. Loading our project from VeryColdplay's GitHub.   
   
                5. Loading our project from VeryColdplay's GitHub   
                    Step 1: Open Your Mac Terminal   
                    Step 2: Navigate to Your Desired Folder   
                    Step 3: Clone the Project from GitHub   
                    Step 4: Navigate into the Project Folder   
                    Step 5: Open the Project in VS Code   
                    Step 6: Install Dependencies   
                    Step 7: Preview the MkDocs Project
