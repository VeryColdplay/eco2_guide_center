#### Key Summary (6W1H)
WHO:            Developers in development team   
   
WHAT & WHEN:    1. Decision making (by April)   
                2. Major development completed (~70% by June-July)   
                3. Revisions and finalization (Second Half of the Year)   
   
HOW & WHICH:            1. Based on the Original Contents, but: with necessary 1) Reorganization, 2) Improvements, 3) Inserting Images   
                2. Work smartly (Discuss thoroughly before execution so that rework is minimized)   
                3. Keep frequent communication   
                    Between institutions, through coordinator   
                    Key communication channels are as follows:   
                    - 한희↔박정은   
                    - 한희↔장예은   
                    - 연구원들↔교수님   
                    - 박정은↔장예은   
                    - 이승연↔장예은   
                    - 장예은↔유기형   
                4. Technical approach   
                    Compatibility with both Mac and Windows platforms   
                    Required tools for development and documentation include:   
                    - Python (essential for MkDocs)   
                    - Git (version control for local tracking)   
                    - Visual Studio Code, VS Code (main editing environment)   
                    - MkDocs (Core documentation tool)   
                    - GitHub (to ensure a stable setup and smooth collaboration workflow)   
                    Once you, maybe 희, have completed the environment setup with Python, Git, VS Code, and MkDocs,   
                    you will primarily work with the following languages and file types:   
                    - Markdown (.md)   
                    - YAML (.yml)   
                    - HTML (.html)   
                    - CSS (.css)   
                    - JavaScript (.js)   
                    - Python (.py)   
                    For the ECO2 Logic Guide, both mathematical expressions and mindmaps are crucial to effectively convey;   
                    - Mermaid.js: for mindmap   
                    - MathJax (or KaTeX): for LaTeX, a grammar for mathematical expressions   

WHY:            ... (TBD someday, at some point during the project)
